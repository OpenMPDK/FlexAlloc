# Bugs
- [ ] Fix The python test fails because of sync. If you sync a flexalloc volume and then try to allocate an object we get a failure.
- [ ] We removed the wlist.txt and its related tests from sources because of licence issues. Activate that tests again.
# Enhancements
- [ ] Add FLEXALLOC\_ERRF to enable more detailed error messaging
